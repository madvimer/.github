Kyverno, is an Open source policy engine designed specifically for Kubernetes. 
The word "Kyverno" is a Greek word for "Govern". It was originally developed by [Nirmata](https://nirmata.com/) and is now a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) sandbox project.
Kyverno runs as an admission controller and can validate, mutate, and generate any configuration data based on customizable policies. 

For more information about Kyverno, check out [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/docs/) to help install, address Kubernetes complexity and easily enforce security and best practice policies across clusters and workloads.
